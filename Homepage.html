            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>With the prolonged orders for shelter in place, there has been a common theme of problems on the rise - people are struggling to find a form of normalcy. Research suggests some of the most common stressors during quarantine include boredom, frustration, and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world due to confinement, loss of usual routine, and reduced social and physical contact with others. </p>

            <h2>What PeersPersevere is Doing to Help</h2>
            <p>With these problems and statistics in mind, we came up with PeersPersevere to help college students get connected with their fellow classmates and college students from all over the US. We recognize the need for a platform that is conducive for students to use for academic and extracurricular purposes. Our website provides two distinct services. First, students can form study groups to keep themselves accountable and stay motivated for their online classes. An algorithm will help match students based off of availability and study styles. The current shelter in place has also led many to pick up new hobbies. Research suggests a major benefit of engaging in hobbies is improvement in emotional well-being and mental health as it can help alleviate feelings of anxiety. This leads us to the website&apos;s second feature as it will be a platform for college students to find and build a community we will be calling <q>peer pods</q> over similar interests and hobbies. </p>
